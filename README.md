# MRI-Machine-Learning
neural network is used to distinguish affected brains from healthy ones
An array of photo's provided from free source are read and extracted one by one
The neural network trains on affected and healthy brain MRI
The test is carried out to see if we distinguish cancer successfully
The precision is high however we would need thousands of thoudsands of MRI t be sure we do it with such a high efficiency close to 100%
